# symfony
Largest values for the Stern Sequence. Made using Symfony framework. Project I was tasked to do as a part of the recruitment process. 

To get the idea of how the algorithm works i suggest looking into this article (formula is described on the first page):
https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL17/Lansing/lansing2.pdf

You can also use command line to run the algorithm, just type:

php bin\console app:komenda n

where n is a number between 1 and 99999.
